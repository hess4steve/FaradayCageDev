Hello! Here is how many of each Bracket type you will need.

For the "LBW_Bracket_Front_Cage.stl" you will need to print out 4. These go on the front face, and allow the doors to open. They are prone to cracking so be advised to be gentler with them.
For the "Triangle_Corner_Bracket.stl" you will need to print out 24. These go on the corners of the frame (minus the front), the corners of the doors on the outside, but not on the corners for the bottom face of the cage.
For the "Double_Bracket_Middle_Support.stl" you will need to print out 8. These go on the ends of the supports in the middle of the top, back, right, and left sides.
For the "Bottom_Triangle_Corner_Bracket.stl" you will need to print out 4. These go on the bottom face of the cage on the corners. These may need to be modified if your screw head is too big or wide to fit and sit flush.
