Hello! 
You may wonder why these formats are here. That's because I use blender for modeling. Call it a bad habit.
The original was made in blender. I just made it to lay out what I needed to do.
That's also why the hinges are just squares, same with the handles. You can get the idea.
If you're looking to simulate in some sort of computational software, I hate to break it to you, but you'll have to model that yourself.
I made this project solo, so I had to cut a few corners to save time. Modeling and simulating before building was one such corner.
(Plus, Faraday cages are kind of hard to mess up, except maybe if you forget to ground them? Not sure.)
Also, I have no idea how I'd go about doing that. This is meant for people on a budget who need a Faraday cage. Simple as that.
